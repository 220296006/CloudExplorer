# Setting Up a Firestore Local Emulator for React Native

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Firebase CLI installed
- Your existing React Native CloudExplorer app

## Step 1: Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

## Step 2: Initialize Firebase in your project

Navigate to your project root directory:

```bash
cd C:\Users\thabi\Desktop\CloudExplorer
firebase login
firebase init
```

During initialization:

- Select Firestore as one of the features
- Choose to use an existing project or create a new one
- Accept defaults for other options

## Step 3: Configure Firebase emulators

```bash
firebase init emulators
```

- Select Firestore when prompted
- Choose a port for the Firestore emulator (default is 8080)
- Optionally enable Firestore UI

## Step 4: Start the emulator

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

## Step 5: Update your React Native app to use the emulator

For React Native, you need to point to your development machine's IP address (not localhost). Add this code to your Firebase initialization:

```javascript
// In your Firebase configuration file (e.g., firebase.js)
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFirestore, connectFirestoreEmulator } from 'firebase/firestore';

// Your Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  // Your existing config
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore();

// Connect to emulator in development
if (__DEV__) {
  // Use your computer's IP address instead of localhost
  // This is required for React Native to connect from the device/emulator
  const HOST = '192.168.1.X'; // Replace with your actual IP address
  connectFirestoreEmulator(db, HOST, 8080);
  console.log('Connected to Firestore emulator');
}

export { db };
```

## Step 6: Finding your computer's IP address

- On Windows: Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`
- On Mac: Open Terminal and type `ifconfig`
- Look for your local network IP address (usually starts with 192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x)

## Step 7: Allow connections through your firewall

Make sure port 8080 (or whatever port you chose) is accessible through your firewall.

## Step 8: Testing your React Native app

Run your React Native app in development mode:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
# or
npx react-native run-ios
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connectivity issues

If your React Native app can't connect to the emulator:

- Verify your IP address is correct
- Ensure you're on the same network
- Check that the emulator is running
- Try disabling any VPNs

### Android Emulator-specific issues

If using the Android Emulator, you can use the special IP `10.0.2.2` which points to your host machine's localhost:

```javascript
// Only for Android Emulator
if (__DEV__ && Platform.OS === 'android') {
  connectFirestoreEmulator(db, '10.0.2.2', 8080);
}
```

### iOS Simulator-specific issues

For iOS Simulator, localhost or 127.0.0.1 should work:

```javascript
// Only for iOS Simulator
if (__DEV__ && Platform.OS === 'ios') {
  connectFirestoreEmulator(db, '127.0.0.1', 8080);
}
```

## Bonus: Creating a comprehensive development setup

You can conditionally connect to different endpoints based on your environment:

```javascript
if (__DEV__) {
  if (Platform.OS === 'android' && !device.isPhysical) {
    // Android Emulator
    connectFirestoreEmulator(db, '10.0.2.2', 8080);
  } else if (Platform.OS === 'ios' && !device.isPhysical) {
    // iOS Simulator
    connectFirestoreEmulator(db, '127.0.0.1', 8080);
  } else {
    // Physical device
    connectFirestoreEmulator(db, '192.168.1.X', 8080); // Your computer's IP
  }
  console.log('Connected to Firestore emulator');
}
```
