# Cloud Explorer: User Journey & System Logic Walkthrough

## Introduction

This document outlines the typical user flow within the Cloud Explorer application, detailing the interactions between the frontend (React Native app), backend (Node.js API), Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions), and the AI service. It follows the architecture where content is managed centrally and user progress is tracked individually.

## System Components Involved

* **User:** The learner using the mobile app.
* **Frontend App (React Native):** The mobile interface the user interacts with.
* **Backend API (Node.js/Express):** Hosted service (e.g., Cloud Run, Compute Engine) handling business logic, data validation, database interactions, and AI service calls. Prefixed with `/api/v1`.
* **Firebase Authentication:** Manages user sign-up, sign-in, and identity verification.
* **Firestore Database:** Stores application data:
  * `users/{userId}`: User profiles, settings, learning progress summary.
    * `users/{userId}/progress/{progressId}`: Detailed start/complete status per resource.
    * `users/{userId}/certifications/{certId}`: User's earned certifications.
  * `modules/{moduleId}`: Shared module definitions (metadata).
    * `modules/{moduleId}/sections/{sectionId}`: Shared section content (Markdown).
  * `quizzes/{quizId}`: Shared quiz definitions with stored AI-generated questions.
  * `exams/{examId}`: Shared exam definitions with stored AI-generated questions.
  * `quizResults/{resultId}`: Individual user attempts/results for quizzes.
  * `examResults/{resultId}`: Individual user attempts/results for exams.
  * `notifications/{notificationId}`: User-specific notifications.
* **Cloud Functions:** Serverless functions triggered by events.
  * `initializeNewUser` (Auth `onCreate` Trigger): Creates the initial Firestore user document.
  * `setAdminClaim` (HTTPS Callable): Used by admins to grant roles (via Admin Interface).
* **AI Service (Hugging Face):** External API used by the backend to generate questions.
* **Admin User:** Manages content via a separate Admin Interface/API calls.

## The User Journey: Step-by-Step

---

### Step 0: Content Creation & Management (Admin Task - Prerequisite)

*This happens *before* a regular user interacts and is managed by administrators.*

1. **Admin Access:** Admin logs into the dedicated Admin Interface (Web App).
2. **Module Creation/Update:**
    * Admin uses the interface form to define a module (title, description).
    * Admin adds/edits sections using a Markdown editor within the form.
    * Admin submits the form.
    * Admin Interface calls the protected Backend API (`POST` or `PUT /api/v1/modules/...`).
    * Backend API validates the request (checks admin auth) and saves the module metadata and section Markdown content to the global `modules` collection and its `sections` subcollection in Firestore.
3. **Exam Metadata Creation/Update:**
    * Admin uses the interface to define exam metadata (title, description, duration, associated modules).
    * Admin Interface calls the protected Backend API (`POST` or `PUT /api/v1/exams/...`).
    * Backend API saves/updates the exam metadata in the global `exams` collection in Firestore.
4. **Quiz/Exam Question Generation & Storage:**
    * Admin selects a Module (for a quiz) or an Exam (for exam questions) in the Admin Interface.
    * Admin clicks a "Generate Questions" button, specifying quantity/types if needed.
    * Admin Interface calls the protected Backend API (`POST /api/v1/quizzes/generate-and-save` or `POST /api/v1/exams/generate-and-save`).
    * Backend API fetches the necessary content context (module markdown or exam context) from Firestore.
    * Backend API calls the AI Service (Hugging Face) via `executeWithRetry`.
    * Backend API parses the AI response into a structured array of questions.
    * Backend API saves the generated questions array into the corresponding document in the global `quizzes` or `exams` collection in Firestore.
    * Admin Interface shows confirmation or the generated questions for review/editing.
5. **Result:** The shared learning content (modules, quizzes, exams with stored questions) is available in Firestore for all users.

### Step 1: New User Sign-Up / First Login

1. **User Action:** User opens the Frontend App and chooses to sign up/in (e.g., "Sign in with Google") on the AuthScreen.
2. **Frontend Auth Service:** The app's `GoogleAuthService` (or `AppleAuthService`) initiates the sign-in flow using the appropriate SDK (`@react-native-google-signin/google-signin`, etc.).
3. **Firebase Auth:** User authenticates with the provider (Google/Apple). The provider returns credentials (like an ID token) to the Frontend App.
4. **Frontend Auth Service:** The service uses the provider's credential to sign the user into **Firebase Authentication** (`auth().signInWithCredential(credential)`).
5. **Firebase Auth Backend:** Firebase Authentication verifies the credential. If it's a **new user**, it creates a new Firebase Auth user record.
6. **Cloud Function Trigger:** The creation of the new Firebase Auth user record **automatically triggers** the deployed `initializeNewUser` Cloud Function.
7. **`initializeNewUser` Cloud Function:**
    * Executes server-side.
    * Reads the new user's auth data (UID, email, etc.).
    * Creates a new document in the `users` collection in Firestore (`users/{uid}`) with default profile information, settings (`darkMode: false`, `emailUpdates: true`, etc.), and an initialized `learningProgress` object (e.g., `completedModules: [], score: 0`).
    * (Optional) Creates a welcome notification in the `notifications` collection for this `userId`.
8. **Frontend Auth Service:** The `signInWithCredential` call in the frontend completes, returning the `UserCredential`. The frontend checks `userCredential.additionalUserInfo?.isNewUser`.
9. **Frontend App:**
    * Stores the user's authentication state (e.g., listens to `onAuthStateChanged`).
    * If `isNewUser` was true, it might trigger a welcome tour or prompt for initial profile details (like bio), but it **does not** create the Firestore document.
    * Navigates the user to the main part of the app (e.g., HomeScreen or DashboardScreen).

---

### Step 2: Browse Modules

1. **User Action:** User navigates to the "Modules" tab/screen in the Frontend App.
2. **Frontend App:** Makes an API call to the Backend API to fetch the list of available modules.
    * `GET /api/v1/modules/list`
3. **Backend API:**
    * Receives the request.
    * Queries the global `modules` collection in Firestore (fetching metadata like title, description, duration, maybe quiz IDs - but *not* section content yet).
    * Sends the list of module metadata back to the Frontend.
4. **Frontend App:** Displays the list of modules (e.g., in cards) using the received data.

---

### Step 3: Starting & Reading a Module

1. **User Action:** User taps on a specific module (e.g., "Compute Engine") in the list.
2. **Frontend App:**
    * Records the start of the module by calling the Backend API:
        * `POST /api/v1/users/{userId}/progress` (Body: `{ resourceType: 'module', resourceId: 'compute-engine', action: 'start' }`)
    * Navigates to the `ModuleDetailScreen`.
    * Makes an API call to fetch the sections for this specific module:
        * `GET /api/v1/modules/compute-engine/sections`
3. **Backend API (`/progress`):**
    * Receives the progress update.
    * Authenticates the user.
    * Writes/updates a document in `users/{userId}/progress/module_compute-engine` in Firestore, setting `status: 'in_progress'`, `startedAt`.
    * Updates `lastActivity` on the main `users/{userId}` document.
    * Returns success.
4. **Backend API (`/sections`):**
    * Receives the section request.
    * Queries the `sections` subcollection under `modules/compute-engine` in Firestore, ordering by the `order` field.
    * Reads the `title` and `content` (Markdown string) for each section.
    * Sends the array of section data back to the Frontend.
5. **Frontend App:**
    * Receives the section data.
    * Displays the module title and description.
    * Uses a Markdown rendering component (like `react-native-markdown-display`) to show the content of the first (or selected) section.
    * Provides navigation (e.g., tabs, swipe, next button) for the user to move between sections.
6. **User Action:** User reads through the Markdown content of each section.

---

### Step 4: Completing Module Content Reading

1. **User Action:** User finishes the last section or explicitly marks the module reading as complete via a button.
2. **Frontend App:** Calls the Backend API to record content completion:
    * `POST /api/v1/users/{userId}/progress` (Body: `{ resourceType: 'module', resourceId: 'compute-engine', action: 'complete' }`)
3. **Backend API:**
    * Receives the progress update.
    * Authenticates the user.
    * Updates the document `users/{userId}/progress/module_compute-engine` in Firestore, setting `status: 'completed'`, `completedAt`.
    * (Optional - based on your logic) *Might* update the main `users/{userId}` document to add `'compute-engine'` to the `learningProgress.completedModules` array if reading alone suffices, or this might wait until after a quiz/exam.
    * Updates `lastActivity` on the main user document.
    * Returns success.
4. **Frontend App:** Might update the UI to show the module as read or unlock the associated quiz/next step.

---

### Step 5: Taking an Associated Quiz

1. **User Action:** User taps on the "Take Quiz" button associated with the completed module.
2. **Frontend App:**
    * Determines the `quizId` for this module (e.g., `compute-engine-quiz1`, possibly fetched earlier with module metadata).
    * Makes an API call to fetch the quiz questions:
        * `GET /api/v1/quizzes/compute-engine-quiz1`
3. **Backend API:**
    * Receives the request.
    * Reads the document `quizzes/compute-engine-quiz1` from Firestore. This document contains the title, metadata, and the array of `questions` (which were AI-generated and stored previously by an admin).
    * Sends the quiz data (including the questions array) back to the Frontend.
4. **Frontend App:**
    * Receives the quiz data.
    * Navigates to the `QuizzesDetailScreen`.
    * Displays the quiz interface, presenting the questions and answer options.

---

### Step 6: Submitting the Quiz

1. **User Action:** User answers all questions and taps "Submit".
2. **Frontend App:**
    * Locally calculates the `score` (number correct), `totalQuestions`, `percentage`, and `passed` status based on the user's answers and the correct answers received in Step 5.
    * Constructs the result payload.
    * Calls the Backend API to save the result:
        * `POST /api/v1/quizzes/save-result` (Body: `{ userId, moduleId, quizId, score, totalQuestions, percentage, passed, answers?: {...} }`)
3. **Backend API:**
    * Receives the request, authenticates the user.
    * Validates the payload data.
    * Creates a new document in the `quizResults` collection in Firestore, including all submitted data and a server `timestamp`.
    * Updates the `users/{userId}` document in Firestore (e.g., adds a summary to `learningProgress.completedQuizzes`, updates `lastActivity`).
    * Returns a success response, including the ID of the new `quizResults` document and the `passed` status.
4. **Frontend App:**
    * Receives the success response.
    * Displays the quiz result screen (score, passed/failed).
    * May update local state or navigate the user.

---

### Step 7: Viewing Progress

1. **User Action:** User navigates to the "Dashboard" or "Progress" screen.
2. **Frontend App:** Calls the Backend API to get a comprehensive progress overview:
    * `GET /api/v1/users/{userId}/progress`
3. **Backend API:**
    * Receives the request, authenticates the user.
    * Performs multiple Firestore queries in parallel:
        * Gets the main `users/{userId}` document (for `learningProgress` summary).
        * Gets all documents from `users/{userId}/progress/*`.
        * Gets documents from `quizResults` where `userId` matches.
        * Gets documents from `examResults` where `userId` matches.
    * Aggregates this data into a structured response.
    * Sends the aggregated progress data back to the Frontend.
4. **Frontend App:** Displays the progress information (e.g., overall score, completed modules list, quiz/exam history with scores).

---

### Step 8: Starting an Exam

1. **User Action:** User navigates to the "Exams" screen and selects an exam (e.g., "Cloud Digital Leader").
2. **Frontend App:**
    * Determines the `examId` (e.g., `cloud-digital-leader-exam`).
    * Makes an API call to fetch the exam details and questions:
        * `GET /api/v1/exams/cloud-digital-leader-exam`
3. **Backend API:**
    * Receives the request.
    * Reads the document `exams/cloud-digital-leader-exam` from Firestore. This document contains metadata (title, duration) and the array of stored, AI-generated `questions`.
    * Sends the exam data back to the Frontend.
4. **Frontend App:**
    * Receives the exam data.
    * Navigates to the `ExamsScreen` (or a specific exam-taking screen).
    * Displays the exam interface, starts the timer, and presents questions.

---

### Step 9: Completing and Submitting an Exam

1. **User Action:** User answers all questions within the time limit and submits the exam.
2. **Frontend App:**
    * Stops the timer.
    * Locally calculates the result: `correctAnswers`, `totalQuestions`, `score` (percentage), `isPassed` status.
    * Constructs the result payload.
    * Calls the Backend API to save the exam result:
        * `POST /api/v1/exams/save-result` (Body: `{ userId, examId, result: { totalQuestions, correctAnswers, score, isPassed, answeredQuestions? } }`)
3. **Backend API:**
    * Receives the request, authenticates the user.
    * Validates the payload.
    * Uses a Firestore **transaction**:
        * Creates a new document in the `examResults` collection with the submitted data and server timestamp.
        * Updates the `users/{userId}` document: adds an entry to `learningProgress.completedExams`, updates `lastActivity`. If passing this exam completes a certification path, potentially update `learningProgress.completedModules` for associated modules as well.
    * Commits the transaction.
    * Returns a success response with the result ID and `isPassed` status.
4. **Frontend App:**
    * Receives the success response.
    * Displays the exam result screen.
    * If passed, may unlock certifications display, badges, or access to further content.
